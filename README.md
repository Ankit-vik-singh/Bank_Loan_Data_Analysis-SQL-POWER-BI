# || PROJECT SUMMARY ||

### In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data using Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI. The project involved several steps, including database creation, data importation, and connection to Power BI for analysis.

## Key Highlights:

- Created a database in Microsoft SQL Server and imported bank loan data.
- Connected SQL Server to Power BI to perform data analysis.
- Developed three dashboards to address specific problem statements:
-    A- Summary Dashboard: Monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications, funded amount, amount received, average interest rate, and 
  debt-to-income ratio.
-    B- Overview Dashboard: Utilizing charts to analyze monthly trends, regional disparities, loan term distribution, employment length impact, loan purpose breakdown, and home ownership analysis.
-    C- Details Dashboard: A comprehensive view of essential loan-related metrics and data points, facilitating efficient access to critical information.

## Final Step

### Conducted testing of all values obtained in the Power BI report by writing logical SQL queries in Microsoft SQL Server. This ensured accurate cross-checking of values between Power BI and SQL Server, enhancing data integrity.
